Question: Is it possible that a GFS client application reads an old version of a file? 
If not, explain why. If yes, give an example.

Answer:
    It is possible for the GFS Client to read an old version of a file. But the impact is rather low because 
    most of the chuck operations are append-only. So it will probably read a premature end of file rather than
    an outdated value.

    Example:    
        If a chunckserver hosting a chuck is down during a mutation. It will become stale.

        If the client had cached this location of chuck, it might read from this replica before the 
        information is refreshed.
