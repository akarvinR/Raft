Does Borg handle master failures the same way as worker machine failures? Explain your answer.


It handles differently.

If a worker machine fails, the tasks are rescheduled to other available machines.

If a master fails, the Borgmaster is replicated with 5 total replicas, one of them acts as a leader and handles request.

If the leader fails, a new leader is elected using paxos consensus.
