How do virtual nodes (tokens) facilitate load balancing in Dynamo?



When nodes join, multiple virtual nodes (more if the system is more capable and less if the system is less capable) are created.
These virtual nodes accept a roughly equivalent amount of load from each of the other virtual nodes.

If a node leaves, the load handled by the virtual nodes is EVENLY dispersed across the remaining available virtual nodes.


So the load is dispersed evenly in both scenarios.
