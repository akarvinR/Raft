# Lecture Questions

We use your repo to collect lecture question responses. For each lecture (with questions) `X`, please create a separate txt file `lecX.txt` which contain your answers. After completing your responses in the respective `lecX.txt` files, submit your answers by pushing them to the GitLab repository.
