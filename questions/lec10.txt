In Thor, after a server commits a transaction, the server sends out invalidation messages to clients 
that are caching data written by that transaction. It may take a while for those invalidations to arrive
. Is it possible that other clients read stale cached data in the meantime? Explain why or why not.

Yes, it is possbile for the clients to read stale data. But, it will not pass current-version check or 
transactions check.

Usually, when there is a network partition the client might read from stale version before dropping the object
from its cance since the message (invalidation) has not arrived.
